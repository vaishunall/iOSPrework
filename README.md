App Idea: Skincare Reminder App.

Through social media, peers, and my personal experience, I've noticed that commitment people are making to their skincare regimen. However, it can be hard to remember which days to use a certain product or to do your skincare in the first place. This app would have a weekly schedule feature in which users can enter the products they use in their day and night routine for each day. The user can also set times to when they usually do their routine, and the app will send notifications at those times reminding the user to do their skincare. I'd also like to implement some kind of reward feature to encourage the users, for example, a plant that grows as the users regularly do their routine or a "streak" that shows how many days a user has successfully completed their routine without skipping.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
It took me a while to understand the storyboard and the drag-and-drop features for UI elements and use the assistant for IBAction, but once I did so, I was able to use it with ease.

Changes I've made to the app:
- Changed the font family and size
- Added a view behind the text to make sure there the text is clearly visible regardless of the background color
- Changed the background colors to more red/pink/purple colors by changing the RGB value (set red to always be one) so the background would better match the button
- Added rounded corners to the view and the button
